There are plenty of differences between traditional webpage editing (such as using Adobe Dreamweaver software to design a webpage). The new standards of HTML5 and CSS3 are amazing. These parts are easy , I think. Probablly because I can use photoshop, firework and other Adobe softwares fluentlly. What's more, it is easy to use css. But using it well isn't an easy task. 2018.02 \u00b6 learning basic javascript codes. Basic JS codes are similar to other coding languages. JS is an O-O programming language. The polymorphism isn't obvious. ECMAscript, a standard coding plan, is developing rapidly. ES5 is ripe and stable. In 2015, ES6 use class to create an object (from cpp?). And ES6 use string module. It maybe come from Ruby. Recently some frineds told me that NodeJS could work in desktop application. In one day JS will work every place. 2018.03 \u00b6 I got a github account. Learning git is an essential step. When I fell asleep, I find that writing and coding could make me patient and calm. I find a project, Codecombat. Codecombat is a perfect open-source project. It uses coffeeScript rather than javascript. A little upset => => In this project, people can learn coding including Python, Javascript, Java and other languages. Learing coding and English every day! 2018.04 \u00b6 Read readme.text of data repository. Finish user's information setting in github. I can make a basic webpage using sublime editor. HTML is the structure of pages, CSS is the style of pages, JS is the magic and action of pages. Other small JS plug-ins can help me to ease working stress. The fullpage plug-in can make different pages switching fluently. And a small shopping project (similar to JD) and a take-out meal project are finished. 2018.05 \u00b6 laern senior javascript programming. And JS is not easy. Some JS codes are unique. Such as 0.1 plus 0.2 not equal 0.3, however, 0.1 plus 0.5 equal 0.6. And ajax is excellent. Now axios can work well without ajax. In the free time, I learn about main structures and MVC or MVVM design modal. (Modal-View-View-Modal). The main structures are Angular, Vue and React. Recently, Angular is too large to design a single page, so people choose React or Vue. And I design three shopping webpages for mobile devices. The pages use different methods to suit different length and height(percentage, flex, rem). Now I should use it fluently. 2018.06 \u00b6 Continue learning structue. Using modals can save more time and make codes use widely. Start designing Leisure website and a company fullpage. We have a small team and my main job is to design webpages. And I need to test my codes with others groupnumbers. There are many bugs that we can't realise until testing together. And sometimes designer perfer another color or logo, I need to clip them right away. The jobs are interesting and busy. Tired but happy. And I learn some chrome inside render methods. There are three engines and each engines can render diferent parts of webpage. There are much knowledge that I need to learn. As a developing front-end develper, I have to know Internet basic and data structure knowledge as quickly as I can. 2018.07 \u00b6 I start to learn Mina frame for WeChat small app. I have a personal Wechat Official Platform. In one day, I will design my own WeChat Small App by myself. The Mina frame use different programming language, wxml and wxss. Wxml language uses different tags(such as View tag). Wxss use different length, rpx, rather than px or percentage methods. This frame has many useful modules and we can easily use the APIs. However, data tramsfer by using props and state is not easy for me. Never stop coding! 2018.08 \u00b6 August is a very busy month. Not only did I finish so mush codes of html, css, js, but also I learn plenty of new knowledge points. To be honest, I didn't have one day rest. At night I always learn new grammar. And there are some details about August. Do some unit test. It is significant to do unit test before using a new javascript API. When we finished writing an API, we must test it right away. The main test tool are Mocha or Jest. Using assertions to test if the API could return a right value. Unit test is basic test. The basic method is test APIs one by one. The advanced method is test lots of APIs once. Using one result as other API's parameters. But you should make sure that most of APIs are right and can return what you want. If there are some errors or warnings, you should check them one by one. For a fresh bird, I choose the first method now. In the future, I will use the advanced methods to release my work pressure and deal with other projects. Time is precious. learn new OS\uff08operating system\uff09 I heard MAC OS and Linux OS before. But I didn't operate them before. Now I need to learn the basic knowledge. The Linux system is much different from Windows system. I use Ubuntu, a special linux OS. The base and vim command line need to remember. In the future, I will use them much. Bye-Bye windows. Till now I can't find adequate PS and other softwares in MAC. I didn't have an Apple ID so I can't down app from App Store. The NodeJS and NPM parts are useful in MAC. I still use sublime as my editor software. The webstorm and atom editor are useful too. new knowledge of Jest What's more, there are many new knowledge points. I need to learn reactstrap(bootstrap in react framework). The ECMAscript6 is necessary. The differences between const and let (let use much memory than const, about 2% to 3% maybe). And array function is useful. It can bind this to using function automaticly.Others, learn button/DropDown/Modal compoennts of reactstrap. React framework contains several life cycle fucntion. How to use them fluently needs much time to practice. And slate.js framework, a rich text framework, is also important. Map Object/Selectiom/Value/Change and ... blob file. write later because there are much things to deal now. reading blog from RuanYF. 2018.09 \u00b6 Plan: learn slate.js (the main APIs) and react framework step by step. Hurry up! And this is the first time to use vim to write readme.md And use it more. There are so many things to learn. And I found that it is important for us to learn not only code basic using but also inner logic of basic. For instance, learning slate-core codes is significant for understanding lower codes logic. And I learn code (JS) data structure of JS. The bacis data strcuture is Array. In JS, we can use Array to create other complex data structure. (queue/stack/linked chart). What's more, the basic network knowledge is also essential and basic. 2018.10 \u00b6 For a front-end engineer, I should use front-end technique fluently. The main structure and basic logic and data structure. And I thought that I should not only know my aspects but also learn other aspects. The basic network and back-end knowledge are also important. I needn't write back-end codes, I just know their methods and thoughts. And I should learn front-end parts firstly. Recently work is not busy (compared with Sep). And there are other things I have to deal with, such as tax, insurance, family tree : ) I will spend at least 20 percentages of my time and monty into future development (books and other online lecture). Never give up! Just hurry up! There are so many things to learn. And I found that it is important for us to learn not only code basic using but also inner logic of basic. For instance, learning slate-core codes is significant for understanding lower codes logic. And I learn code (JS) data structure of JS. The bacis data strcuture is Array. In JS, we can use Array to create other complex data structure. (queue/stack/linked chart). What's more, the basic network knowledge is also essential and basic. 2018.11 \u00b6 1.Basic knowledge Recently I read some books of traditional JS methods. Before ES6 ( class and other new points of OO, object-oriented ) come into our eyes, the constructor is important. The curry function, which use less parameters in a single function, can gain more useful features. Eg: for a pure function, y = f(x). When we set a special x, this function can return a solid y for this special x. This function is called pure function. And if we enter a special parameters into another function, that function returns are not fixed. There are a lot of mess. So the main thoughts of curry function is that we should use only one parameters in a special function. If a function have too much codes and parameters, we should separate them into different parts. This method can decrease function coupling\uff0c and increase codes reusability. (PS: learn more CS words). The memory of function. In fibonacci method, we can use resursion to culculate. function return n < 2 ? n : fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2). The basic method has a shortage. And we have to calculate fibonacci(3) for too many time for instance. A new method is we can use closure, and create an array to store some result. If function has calculated some results, read it from the result array directly, else calculate it and store the results into array. The result array is in a closure. Finally, we just return the last result rather than result array. If n equals 10, traditional methods need 400 times, however, new method just needs about 30 times. 2.Learning methods learn more of data structure. If I just use some basic components in my daily work, I won't get more new information of CS development. It is necessary for me to learn new method and new grammar(ES7). The latest React structure has some useful utils. React-Routers and React-Native are some of them. I need to learn them. We all know that if you didn't study every day, you would been last for a long distance. So just hurry up! Don't hesitate to learn new knowledge. We all know that it is totally diffcult for us to learn in such a short periods, but we need to learn for the future. Two years age, angular is hot in whole China, plenty of my friends use angular as their basic front-end structure. Now, if you use angular, it is not a wise choice. 3.Singles' day thoughts Today is Nov 11 th , the traditional shopping days. Ten years age, shopping day was created by Alibaba. Ten years later, there are 100 billion yuan trades during just ten hours. But I never buy any goods, because I must learn new CS knowledge. During ten years development, the main trades have changed a lot. Much people use mobile Apps to buy goods thought internet. And basic desktop browsers are decrease. And I need to learn some mobile front-end methods. First, mobile app use lastest brower in Android or iphone, so we need't deal with old ie version. The new mobile screen and flex design are more important. Second, our mobile phone's hardwares are becoming more and more gaint. We can add some complex tecnology to increase clients thought. Third, 5G network will use in daily life. And we need to thought how to open web page sooner. And sending much data or async functions will use much. Using lazy-loading tec is also important. 2018.12 \u00b6 The last month of 2018 is arriving. How time flies! This year I faced lots of differences in my life. It is a turning point for me. There are lots of bugs in my codes which I wrote in last several months. In the beginning period, our product has a basic design, however, now design has some adjustments so that some codes are not good enough for new features. So fix them as soon as possible. I learn some design method in React. We all know that React use props and status. When some datas need to transfered from one component to another comonennt, we can use props. But when we want to transfer data from child component to parent component, props are not useful as before. So we can set a hoop-function in parent component. Transfer this function by props. When child component was rendered or some events happen, we can use this hoop function to listen event happened. The function name can use \"on doing something\". I find it is so busy in my daily life. And it may be the real life. Just face the difficults and overcome my weaknesses. I have to balance life, job, health, family and so on. It may be a little tough in the early period. Step by step, just do it! 2019 \u00b6 2019.01 \u00b6 Happy new year and just continue coding! In 2019, there are several things I need to learn. It is obvious that CS develep rapidly, so learning new knowledge is necessary to every code farmer(hahaha). Don't hesitate to code! There are much things that are useful. I am sure that svg and canvas will replace traditional image ,such as png and icon. And I think watermark-dom and echarts are amazing. Using python to create html is so convenient. These techs should be learned as soon as possible. Canvas and csv image are also useful. These days I found that old knowledge should be learned again so that we can get new treasure. And fix some weaknesses during this period. Learning some difficult things is needed. 2019.02 \u00b6 Happy Spring Festicval! The code-mirror is a useful library when we show codes in different styles. These days I think that we should learn new knowledge forever. 2019.03 \u00b6 At the last day in March, I need a review about this month. There are some thoughts. How to deal with new knowledge and old tect knowledge? React-Router is much better than hash-transfer. And it may save more resources. When we use tag to jump to other page, the whole page don't reload, React just repaint for the added component. The inner tag is , and react-router forbid the default function of tag. You shouldn't create a circle, and you should use the circle. Make our dialogs and other component more useful. Everyone have same time in one day. God gives us same time. In a whole day, working hard and having a rest and having a date is not an easy thing. Now I should grasp more precious time in learning. And exeresicing is also important in the free time. Don't sit for a long time and don't sleep too late. If you did that, you would regret in one day. 2019.04 \u00b6 I read a book called\u300aMake you code cleaner\u300b.This is the main opinions: a function should contain single function and codes as less as possible. Use clear parameter as name of variable. A funciton should do only one thing. A class or a component in React should show a single UI component. And modify your codes after you write down them. When you review your codes, you can change and delete much useless codes. RYF said, we should learn inner knowledge of coding. We all know that structure can change in one day, but the basic data structure and algie is still there. Write more and learn some inner thought in code. It is important. In the free time ,wu shouldn't do the basic things once and another times, but we can deal with tough problems for many hours. Because if you can resolve the tough problem, you are making progress. 2019.05 \u00b6 What is the difference between code farmer and code designer? The farmer can only fix some bugs, can build a wall which is not good, however, thr designer can create some codes and build a beautiful house. So basic logic is more important than fix some easy bugs. And important methods are also important. 2019.06 \u00b6 After about one year coding, I found that I have wrote down more than 40 thousands lines of code in public repo in github(seahub/editor/dtable/api). I need to learn more knowledge about network/algie/data-structure in my free time. There are many coding language in different area, but the above basic points is similar. Seven years age, I started to learn basic computer programming(C), then I learned basic C++ by myself(just a little C++). Five years age, python was hot and I know it is a glue and can generate codes from C and C++, however, I didn't learn python at that time. Two years ago, I learn a little visual basic(VB) when I use excel software, it is boring. And I learn HTML/CSS/JS in the whole year. Last year, I learn a little ruby/java because my co-worker use them as network backend. Now I learn python in my free time, python can do much thing, such as network programming(django/flask), Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, scaning webpage, it is amazing. During these years, my data-structure and database was still weak. Hurry up and make great progress! 2019.07 \u00b6 July is a little busy. During daily work time, I spent much time on dtable. This project is a table just like excel. And data structure and view-model structure is complex. From table to view, from mast to canvas row cell editor. App-store and apply-invert data are devided in several files. And there are many views, a function should work well in every views. There is a mess. In my free time, I learn basic ES5 again.(including DOM Event, except BOM, because I waste much time on other thing). The e-book was written by RYF. Lucky, I pull two requests into this book after I find some mistakes. I thought I could learn it before July 15 th , but I didn't. On weekends(only six days), I climbed mountains and enjoy with friends. So DDL is not valid. Otherwise, it was really hot in my house without a fan or air-conditioner. I bought it last week thought Taobao but I can't receive fan till now! It is hot now! So I have to stay at KFC at evening. Sometimes there were some mosquitos in my house. It was terrible. And I have worked in Seafile for a whole year, I learn much things during the whole year. Everyone have same time in his lives, I am trying to save my time and learn efficiently. 2019.08 \u00b6 Things are still complex. A pile of papers and blogs should be reviewed.I have studied ECMA5 from RuanYF and basic ES6. The mind map is doing. 2019.09 \u00b6 I reviewed and rewrite some notes from 2018-09 to 2018-12. Till now, notes in 2018 have been reviewed. I found some informations: The basic knowledge(JS basic grammar) is more important than structure(such as jquery and react). During the last three years, we used backbone, angular, react, VUE, and in the future, new structure will replace react and VUE again. And basic knowledge is stable. So next month I should learn basic knowledge again. remove C and Java codes from this repo. move VUE to another Repo(special for VUE) review codes in 2018\uff0cthen put them into learn folder.

Not only did I finish so mush codes of html, css, js, but also I learn plenty of new knowledge points. To be honest, I didn't have one day rest. At night I always learn new grammar. And there are some details about August. Do some unit test. It is significant to do unit test before using a new javascript API. When we finished writing an API, we must test it right away. The main test tool are Mocha or Jest. Using assertions to test if the API could return a right value. Unit test is basic test. The basic method is test APIs one by one. The advanced method is test lots of APIs once. Using one result as other API's parameters. But you should make sure that most of APIs are right and can return what you want. If there are some errors or warnings, you should check them one by one. For a fresh bird, I choose the first method now.

Before ES6 ( class and other new points of OO, object-oriented ) come into our eyes, the constructor is important. The curry function, which use less parameters in a single function, can gain more useful features. Eg: for a pure function, y = f(x). When we set a special x, this function can return a solid y for this special x. This function is called pure function. And if we enter a special parameters into another function, that function returns are not fixed. There are a lot of mess. So the main thoughts of curry function is that we should use only one parameters in a special function. If a function have too much codes and parameters, we should separate them into different parts. This method can decrease function coupling\uff0c and increase codes reusability. (PS: learn more CS words). The memory of function. In fibonacci method, we can use resursion to culculate. function return n < 2 ? n : fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2). The basic method has a shortage. And we have to calculate fibonacci(3) for too many time for instance. A new method is we can use closure, and create an array to store some result. If function has calculated some results, read it from the result array directly, else calculate it and store the results into array. The result array is in a closure. Finally, we just return the last result rather than result array. If n equals 10, traditional methods need 400 times, however, new method just needs about 30 times. 2.Learning methods learn more of data structure. If I just use some basic components in my daily work, I won't get more new information of CS development. It is necessary for me to learn new method and new grammar(ES7). The latest React structure has some useful utils. React-Routers and React-Native are some of them. I need to learn them. We all know that if you didn't study every day, you would been last for a long distance. So just hurry up! Don't hesitate to learn new knowledge. We all know that it is totally diffcult for us to learn in such a short periods, but we need to learn for the future. Two years age, angular is hot in whole China, plenty of my friends use angular as their basic front-end structure. Now, if you use angular, it is not a wise choice. 3.Singles' day thoughts Today is Nov 11 th , the traditional shopping days. Ten years age, shopping day was created by Alibaba. Ten years later, there are 100 billion yuan trades during just ten hours. But I never buy any goods, because I must learn new CS knowledge. During ten years development, the main trades have changed a lot. Much people use mobile Apps to buy goods thought internet. And basic desktop browsers are decrease. And I need to learn some mobile front-end methods. First, mobile app use lastest brower in Android or iphone, so we need't deal with old ie version. The new mobile screen and flex design are more important. Second, our mobile phone's hardwares are becoming more and more gaint. We can add some complex tecnology to increase clients thought.
