      <div class="text">
        <p>We are a group of PhDs, PhD candidates, master students, undergraduates and high school students focused on the development and application of non-traditional isotopes in the study of geological, geochemical and cosmochemical processes. Our techniques involve both purification of targeted elements through column chromatography in a clean sample preparation laboratory and high-precision isotopic analyses using Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (MC-ICPMS).</p>
