          <p>There are a variety of opportunities for high school students,  undergraduate and graduate students with background in  geology/chemistry/physics to participate in research in the Non-Traditional  Isotope Laboratory. Research opportunities include theoretical modelling of  major geological processes and hands on experience in chemical and/or  isotopic analyses of samples from Earth's mantle and crust, and  extraterrestrial materials including lunar samples and meteorites. Opportunities are also available for visitors to carry out projects in the  Non-Traditional Isotope Laboratory. Interested students and visitors are  encouraged to contact <a href="http://comp.uark.edu/~fteng/">Fang-Zhen Teng</a> at <a href="mailto:fteng@uark.edu">fteng@u.washington.edu</a> for further information.</p>
          <p><strong>Graduate Students: </strong>The Non-Traditional  Isotope Laboratory provides a unique and welcoming environment for graduate  students who want to pursue studies focused on origins and evolution of the  Earth, Moon and meteorites by combining petrological, mineralogical and  geochemical tools, especially non-traditional isotope geochemistry. Funding  opportunities include fellowships, RAs and TAs. &nbsp; </p>
          <p><strong>Undergraduates:</strong> Undergraduates will have the opportunity to work with faculty,  staff, graduate and other undergraduate students in the Non-Traditional Isotope Laboratory.  They will conduct projects sponsored by local and federal government funding  agencies. Excellent students will be encouraged to apply for Mary Gates  Fellowship and NSF graduate fellowship for graduate school. The primary goal is  to provide students with a foundation for making career choices in Earth  Sciences.</p>
          <p><strong>High-School Students:</strong> There are opportunities for superior high school students who want to gain hands-on  research experience by working on projects led by graduate students, postdocs  and faculty in the Non-Traditional Isotope Laboratory. The opportunity usually  occurs during the summer quarter and is open to students between their junior  and senior year of high school. </p>
          <p><strong>Visitors:</strong> Faculty, postdocs or students, who are employed  or appointed at another institution or organization, can be invited to visit the  Non-Traditional Isotope Laboratory for an extended period to carry out a  collaborative research project. The visit can last from a few months to two  years depending on the nature of the project and the funding situation.</p>
